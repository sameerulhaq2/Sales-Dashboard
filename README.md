<h1>📊📈 Executive Sales Dashboard</h1> 

## 👋 Hi there!

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
For this project, an interactive sales dashboard in Power BI was created so that the CEO and other executive team members could track the company's performance and keep an eye on sales operations in real-time.

<h2> ⚙️ Problem Statement </h2>

The executive team was analyzing business performance using manual Excel reports, which led to:

- Ineffective reporting procedures that result in delays and data inconsistencies.
- Limited awareness of important product trends and sales indicators.
- Lacking real-time information to make decisions quickly.

<h2> 🛠️ Solution </h2>
To address these challenges, I:

- Developed a dynamic dashboard in Power BI, integrated with Oracle EBS for seamless, real-time data updates.
- Designed custom KPIs to measure revenue, sales productivity, and product performance aligned with business goals.
- Implemented sales comparison KPIs, allowing users to see:
   - Same month of the previous year comparison
   - Month on Month comparison.
- Included visual indicators (arrows) to highlight whether there was an increase or decrease in sales across all KPIs, providing clear insights at a glance.
- Enabled drill-down functionality to explore insights across products, regions, and sales teams.
- Automated workflows to ensure timely updates and eliminate manual reporting processes.
- Presented actionable insights directly to the CEO, enhancing the visibility of sales operations.
- Implemented Co-pilot to ask questions related to the dashboard.

<h2> 🎯 Impact </h2>

- Enabled executives to monitor performance in real-time, resulting in a 15% improvement in sales for underperforming sectors.
